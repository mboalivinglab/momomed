# Welcome to the momomed Project!

## 1. The problem
In Sub-Saharan Africa, healthcare expenses fall hardest on families. Families without ready access to cash reserves or investments experience undue burdens in paying for medical care and support. The impact on families is felt most acutely in countries where a vast majority of the population does not have access to government assistance or health insurance, like Cameroon where only 6% of the population purchases health insurance. As a result, 70% of health expenditures come directly from households (out of their pocket). people  uses coping strategies (loans from friends, family and community members, life savings and selling assets)  to pay more than half a billion FCFA per year (the equivalent of nearly 900 million USD) for their health. The burden placed on families in producing cash for urgent healthcare needs, however, is incalculable.
momoMED expands the healthcare safety net to African families by automatically saving a small percentage of mobile money transfers in a healthcare wallet. The money available in the wallet can then be used to pay for discounted healthcare products and services at registered healthcare facilities, including hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies. In Cameroon, mobile money transactions amounted to 10 billion USD  in 2021 and are projected to increase by 31 % each year according to the most recent  GSMA State of the industry report . As mobile money transactions continue to expand to underserved populations, there is an opportunity to leverage the mobile money system to improve access to healthcare financing and protects families against financial shocks. By doing this, momoMED contributes to Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3 Good Health and Well-Being and SDG 10 Reduced Inequalities.

## 3.momomed Overview
momoMED expands the healthcare safety net to African families by automatically saving a small percentage of mobile money transaction in a healthcare wallet. Mobile money users choose to register for momoMED and accept automatic deductions triggered by each of their transactions (up to 10%) into their momoMED wallet. The money available in the wallet can then be used to pay for discounted healthcare products and services at registered healthcare facilities, including hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies. 
The technology facilitates this goal by being: 
* User-friendly—building on the mobile money system known to subscribers.
* Accessible—available as part of the electronic wallet service via USSD, SMS, and mobile applications.
* Transparent—explaining subscription, savings, and payments with SMS messages, notifications, and USSD requests.

## 5.Technical aspects
### Design Challenges
Finished with the ideation and research phase of the project, momoMED enters the design phase in August 2022 energized to overcome the particularities of extending the capabilities of mobile money technology in Sub-Saharan Africa. 
During this phase, momomed team seeks :

- [ ] Firstly, to **build a mobile money wallet** –(mobile money merchant account with clients ledger) that is linked to an already existing mobile money system. As such, we seek to enforce the GSMA API in the mobile money system to trigger actions when there are transactions in the mobile money account of momoMED subscribers. 
- [ ] Secondly, **to build a system that is flexible enough to be expanded to other countries** in Central and West Africa where regulatory measurers differ and taxes imposed by governments present potential barriers for subscriber participation.
- [ ] Thirtly, we want to build momoMED so that **payments for medical care can be discounted at healthcare facilities registered** in the momoMED system. By overcoming these challenges with the design team, momoMED believes it can create a robust product ready to be piloted where African families demand a better healthcare financing system.
- [ ] Lastly, the challenge of momomed is to design a cash-plan based policy suitable for underseved communities to access most wanted health services.
